# Stories

This repository is intended for testing components in isolation, not for publishing.

To test a component:  
1. Create a `Component.stories.tsx` file inside the `stories` folder.  
2. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the Ladle server.  
3. Open `http://localhost:61000` in your browser to view and test the component.
